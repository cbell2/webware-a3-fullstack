This is additional code to help with your `a3`.
The aim of this code is to provide folks with an additional perspective.

The code showcases a form of "update" functionality and "read" functionality, and uses unique IDs for database rows to simplify operations.

- Don't limit yourself to the approaches in this code. There are many possible solutions.
- Don't get hung up on the weird syntax in some places- these are often newer JavaScript features that enable people to write more concise code. 
    - The accompanying links and experimentation should help if the functionality is not clear.
- Do study the code and experiment with it as much as possible if it's helpful.
    - Change things, compare to your own approach so far, etc.

The code has several links in the comments for clarification and further reading.

**If you have questions about the code, I encourage you to post in Slack's #homeworkhelp rather than private messages-- doing so often leads to quicker responses and your questions are likely to be shared by others.**

## To run:
1. run `npm install` to get the `sqlite3` package on your machine (read from `package.json`)
2. run `node create.js` to make an initial database
3. run `node server.js` and navigate your browser to `localhost:8080` as usual
